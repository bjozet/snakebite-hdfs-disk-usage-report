# snakebite-hdfs-disk-usage-report

Utility script to generate hdfs disk usage report using Snakebite. Snakebite is a python library that provides a pure python HDFS client and a wrapper around Hadoops minicluster. The client uses protobuf for communicating with the NameNode and comes in the form of a library and a command line interface. Currently, the snakebite client supports most actions that involve the Namenode and reading data from DataNodes. https://github.com/spotify/snakebite
